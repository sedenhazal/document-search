Turkey has a unitary structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration When three powers are taken into account as the main functions of the state local administrations have little power Turkey does not have a federal system and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in Ankara Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors and town governors Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors or elected by constituents Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies for decision making on municipal issues.
